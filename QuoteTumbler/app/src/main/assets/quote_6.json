  "Once upon a time, there was a little example sentence. It had to be filled with all sorts of random information in order to make it to a certain number of characters. That number of characters was the perfect number of characters to make the sentence useful for testing. I had to add around one hundred more characters to make it to the right number of characters. And it became 399 characters long."
